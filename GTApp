scenario: the user fills the details in the application created using "PowerApps", and the data from the application is stored as "SharePoint list", and using "PowerAutomate" we pull the data from the SharePoint list and send the details via mail in the PowerAutomate flow itself. the respective user group will get the details and they will approve/reject the details submitted by the user. After the user group approves/rejects the details, the status should be updated in the SharePoint list and the status should be reflected in the application created by power apps

Create a flow diagram based on the above scenario professionally and create perfect flow
